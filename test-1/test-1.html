      <!-- 
        <h2>Ice cream is obviously better than cake.</h2> 
        I don't see the purpose of having this statement since statement is listed below too.
      -->
      <p>Ice cream is definitely better than cake!</p>
      <ul>
        <p>I think ice cream is better because:</p>
        <li>It's cold and refreshing</li>
        <li>It comes in a bunch of great flavors</li>
        <li>It doesn't get stale</li>
      </ul>
      <ol>  <!--  Question, is it appropriate to replace ol with ul in this case? the content doesn't seem to need an intentional order. -->
        <p>Also, ice cream is great because:</p>
        <li>You can buy it easily from any store</li>
        <li>You can put toppings on it</li>
      </ol>
